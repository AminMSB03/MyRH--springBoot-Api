# MyRH--springBoot-Api

## Context of the project
As part of its development, the firm MyRH wants to simplify the job search for all Moroccan women and men, for this it asks you to create a web application 
that will be used by recruiters and job seekers.

Each recruiter is a company characterized by an identifier, login, password, address, email, phone number and an image that will be displayed on each job offer 
created by this company.

the registration is valid only for companies, each registration must pass through a verification token valid for 3 minutes for the confirmation of its registration
via an email / SMS

to add a job offer the company must provide a title for this ad, a detailed description, the profile sought (example: web development, accounting ...),
the city, the level of study (example: Bac+2, Bac+3 ...) for the salary remains optional to add it

Each job offer added by a company is subject to validation by a single agent (already created in the MyRH system), he can accept or reject the offer, 
an email is sent to the company

you can be inspired by the site marocannonces for the display of job offers

for better ergonomics, the firm MyRH wishes to make a pagination of 10 offers per page and also use the same graphic design of the site marocannonces.com 
with a search filter to find the suitable offer quickly
